Problem 1 - Android ptree module
===
Contains:
- `README.md` - This file
- `ptree.c` - Source code file
- `ptree.mod.c` - Source module file
- `Makefile` - Makefile for `ptree.c`

`KID` in the Makefile should be changed to your kernel location. Type shell command

`
make
`

will get a kernel module `ptree.ko` in the same directory.
